Apply Object Oriented Approach for Software Requirement:
	
  Major Pillars of  OO
	Abstraction,
	Encapsulation,
	Inheritance & Polymorphism
	
  Minor Pillars of OO
	Typing
	Persistence
	Concurrency
	Modularity
	Hiearchy
	
	OOA----Object Oriented Analysis:
		1.Identify actors, users:

			---endusers- windows shopping
			---customers---registered users----
			--shoppers---- 
			--vendors--- other companies who would help in delivery parcels to customers
			---sales team----order processing details----Operations
			---BOD---- Bussiness Dashboard-- Business Intelligence
			---Store manager (staff)-----Stock verfictation
		
		2.Identify Modules:
			Reusable modules
				Productcatalog modules
				Shoppingcart Module
				Orderprocessing
				MIS ( BI--- reports, dashboard, logging)
				Payment processing
				Shiping
				Membership
 				
				
		3.Identify Relationship with other modules of the project
		  	Orderprocessing Usecase depends on Membership usercase
			Orderprocessing usecase depends on Shoppingcart usercase
			ShoppingCart  usecase dependes on Product catalog
			BI (MIS) usecase depends on Oderprocerssing usecase 
			BI (MIS) usecase depends on Membership usecase 

		
		Using Unified Modeling Language  (UML)Notation
		 UML Diagram:
			Birds Eye view of your project from functionality point view
			Use case Diagram

	OOD----Object Oriented Design:
		Identitfy Objects,
		Idenfitfy classes, packages
		Identify Resubility using Inheritance and containment
		

	OOP----Objectd Oritend Programming-----
		----C++, Java, Typescript, ES JS
		 Write packages
		 Write Classes
		 Write Interface
		 Use existing packages, classes, interface
		 Build Solution



Q.5. Have you created Use Case Diagram to represent Visualized form of your project ?
